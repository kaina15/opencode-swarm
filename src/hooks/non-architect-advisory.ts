 * so "session starts on a non-architect agent" is operationalized as the first
 * user message observed on a non-architect agent (the chat.message hook calls
 * this on every message; the one-shot flag makes it fire once per sessionID).
 *
 * Invariant 8: the guard lives on AgentSessionState (session-keyed, bounded by
 * the existing session-state eviction) — no new module-level session map.
